# Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms for predictive modeling. It works by finding the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Formula

The formula for simple linear regression is:

\[
y = mx + b
\]

Where:
- \( y \) is the predicted value
- \( m \) is the slope of the line (coefficient)
- \( x \) is the input feature
- \( b \) is the y-intercept

## Example Use Cases

- Predicting house prices based on features like square footage and location
- Estimating a personâ€™s weight based on their height
