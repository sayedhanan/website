# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The goal is for the model to learn to make predictions based on input-output pairs.

## Types of Supervised Learning Algorithms

- [Linear Regression](linear-regression.mdx): Predicting continuous outcomes.
- [Classification](classification.mdx): Categorizing data into classes.
- [Decision Trees](decision-trees.mdx): Classifying and predicting outcomes using a tree structure.
- [Neural Networks](neural-networks.mdx): Complex models for learning intricate patterns.
